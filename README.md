# Teamboard

## Setup

1. Initialize the workspace by running:
	```
	sh initialize.sh <your name>
	```
	This will clone the teamboard components into their respecting repositories.

2. Create a machine to develop on:
	
	2.1. Make sure the box image is correct

	If you're not running a 64bit system, open vagrantfile and look for line:
	```
	config.vm.box = "boxes/trusty64"
	```
	Change trusty64 to trusty32 and save. This line defines the base system image 
	used for the virtual machine
		
	2.2. Create the machine
	```
	vagrant up
	```
	This will spawn a headless virtual machine configured with the tools needed
	for development. You just supply the editor of your choosing.

3. Start building, running and testing the code
	```
	vagrant ssh
	```
	This will drop you into the shell of the machine you created above.

## Running

The repositories cloned by running the `initialize.sh` script are the actual
`teamboard` components that we will be developing. These repositories will be
mounted to the home folder of the virtual machine we just created.

For instructions on how to run each component, refer to their individual
repositories.

## Workflow

Use version control and the editor of your choosing on your host machine.

Run, build and test the code on the machine we created by running the `vagrant`
commands. Vagrant will sync the repositories cloned by running `initialize.sh`
into the machine we created, so any changes made to those on your host machine
will reflect on the created machine.
